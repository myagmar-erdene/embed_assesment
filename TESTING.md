# TESTS

The tests to all endpoints were mostly done manually using the Postman. 

Due to the lack of free time, limited deadline and my personal will to focus
and finish most of the endpoints, couldn't make it on time to add the automatic 
tests.

Most of the tests can be done by manipulating the JSON data or changing the 
HTTP request methods of each endpoint in DOCS.md file.
